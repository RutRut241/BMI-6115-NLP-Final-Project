The dishwasher (sanitizer) is drained and cleared out (of food that the screen catches) once or twice per day. It is supposed to be cleared out once every 4 hours, if I remember correctly. 

There are constantly crumbs and sometimes pieces of food in the clean dish bins. These get washed every few weeks when someone finally thinks it's bad enough. 

The buckets used for sanitizer solution rarely get cleaned. The water is changed fairly often, but there is a black film on the inside of most of the buckets. 

Dishes are not washed properly. Every employee there will just rinse out a bowl or utensil, then proceed to use it for something else. Dishes are put back on the shelves after being rinsed as well. Soap and sanitizer have never been used for dishes, as far as I've seen. They just use the pressure sprayer. On several occasions, I've seen brownie pans reused while still having food residue from cinnamon rolls and/or brownies.

The gentleman that helped us took our order and then a man that was behind us. After, he immediately ran behind the counter and started getting food ready. He did not wash his hands or put gloves on. He put a sauce bottle on the counter that was almost empty. He ran to the back and returned with a large bag of sauce. He tried to open the bag with his hands and when it didn't open, he put the bag in his mouth and tore it open. I could not believe what I was seeing. I asked my husband if it was really happening. He said that it was. He wanted to storm out he was so angry. I told him that I wanted to get a refund. The man put the contents of the bag in the container and he poured it on my food. He then came around to give me my food and I asked him for a refund. He asked if we could tell him why. My husband was so furious and yelled that he saw him open the bag with his mouth and asked if they didn't have a knife or scissors that he could have opened it with. The man said that he was really sorry about that"" and went to get us our refund. My husband asked for the managers information. The man said that he was the manager. He did not have a name tag on so we didn't get that information. We told him that we would be filing a complaint with the health department as we were deeply disturbed with the situation.
