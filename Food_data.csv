THE FOOD WAS COLD, IT LOOKED OLD AND WE WATCHED AS THEY SWITCHED OUT MAYBE 5 DISHES, USUALLY PLACING THE OLD FOOD BACK INTO THE NEW TRAY. WE NOTIFIED THE WAITRESS THAT THE FOOD WAS COLD, AND WATCHED WHILE A SERVER WENT OUT AND CHANGED OUT ALL OF THE SPOONS AND STIREED ALL OF THE FOOD TRAYS ON THE MAIN ENTREE TABLE. WE WERE CAREFUL TO ONLY EAT THE MONGOLIAN STIR FRY WHICH WAS COOKED AS WE WATCHED, AND DISHES THAT WE KNEW WERE NEW. UPON LEAVING THE MANAGER TOLD US THAT ONE OF THE SERVERS DID NOT UNDERSTAND THAT SHE WAS TO ""TURN THE FOOD OVER"" OR STIR ON THE MAIN ENTREES. IN MY MIND, THIS DOES NOT CONSTITUTE SWITCHING OUT THE OLD LUNCH FOOD FOR DINNER FOOD.
