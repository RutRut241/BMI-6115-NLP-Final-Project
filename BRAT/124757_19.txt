The owner of Arepas In & Out (31333) came in and said that they were changing Commissary because his has been gutted which was La Herradura de Oro on 1556 W 7800 S. He said he was moving next door to Anaya’s Market but they do not have a permit with us because it is just a market with butcher shop and bakery. I don’t think they have ever had a permit with us. I told him he should not be operating and had to find a commissary first. He said he had no form of moving the mobile trailer anywhere else.
